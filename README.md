## Future Development

Try to add some additional functionality to your application, such as the ability to do the following:

* Add a featured properties page for the most popular places based on reviews
* Add map API for customers to see where properties exist in relation to other landmarks and locations
* Add an ROI generator for the Management tab where those interested in having Ozark Airbnb manage their property can see what their property is worth
* Add a concierge-style feature to show things to do in the area
